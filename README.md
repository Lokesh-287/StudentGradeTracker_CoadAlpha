## How to Run

1. Ensure that Java is installed on your machine.
   You can verify this by typing `java -version` in your terminal.

2. Clone this repository or download the source code.

3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac StockTradingPlatform.java
   ```

4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   java StockTradingPlatform
   ```

## Code Explanation

The program consists of the following main classes:

### 1. **Stock**
Represents a stock with its symbol and price. It provides methods for retrieving and updating the stock price.

```java
class Stock {
    private String symbol;
    private double price;

    public Stock(String symbol, double price) { ... }
    public String getSymbol() { ... }
    public double getPrice() { ... }
    public void setPrice(double price) { ... }
}
```

### 2. **Market**
The `Market` class manages a collection of stocks. It allows adding stocks, retrieving them, updating prices, and displaying the current stocks in the market.

```java
class Market {
    private Map<String, Stock> stocks = new HashMap<>();
    public void addStock(Stock stock) { ... }
    public Stock getStock(String symbol) { ... }
    public void updatePrice(String symbol, double price) { ... }
    public void displayStocks() { ... }
}
```

### 3. **Portfolio**
The `Portfolio` class tracks the user's balance and their stock holdings. It provides methods to buy or sell stocks and display the portfolio.

```java
class Portfolio {
    private Map<String, Integer> holdings = new HashMap<>();
    private double balance;
    public Portfolio(double balance) { ... }
    public void buyStock(String symbol, int quantity, double price) { ... }
    public void sellStock(String symbol, int quantity, double price) { ... }
    public void displayPortfolio() { ... }
}
```

### 4. **TradingEngine**
Handles the buying and selling of stocks, interfacing between the `Market` and `Portfolio` classes to update stock holdings and balances based on stock prices.

```java
class TradingEngine {
    private Market market;
    private Portfolio portfolio;
    public TradingEngine(Market market, Portfolio portfolio) { ... }
    public void buyStock(String symbol, int quantity) { ... }
    public void sellStock(String symbol, int quantity) { ... }
}
```

### 5. **StockTradingPlatform**
The `StockTradingPlatform` is the main class that runs the application. It provides an interactive menu for users to buy, sell, view the market, or check their portfolio.

```java
public class StockTradingPlatform {
    public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
}
```

## Example Usage

Upon running the program, you'll be prompted with a menu to buy, sell, view the market, or check your portfolio:

```
Menu: 1) Buy 2) Sell 3) Market 4) Portfolio 5) Exit
```

### Sample Interaction:

- **Buying a Stock**:
  ```
  Enter stock symbol to buy: AAPL
  Enter quantity: 10
  Bought 10 shares of AAPL
  ```

- **Selling a Stock**:
  ```
  Enter stock symbol to sell: AAPL
  Enter quantity: 5
  Sold 5 shares of AAPL
  ```

- **Displaying the Market**:
  ```
  Market Stocks:
  AAPL: $150.0
  GOOGL: $2800.0
  AMZN: $3400.0
  ```

- **Viewing the Portfolio**:
  ```
  Balance: $8500.0
  Portfolio Holdings:

  ```
